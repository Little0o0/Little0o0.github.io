title: "[NeurIPS 2025] FedRTS: Federated Robust Pruning via Combinatorial Thompson Sampling"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'This paper propose Federated Robust pruning via combinatorial Thompson Sampling (FedRTS), a novel framework designed to develop robust sparse models. FedRTS enhances robustness and performance through its Thompson Sampling-based Adjustment (TSAdj) mechanism, which uses probabilistic decisions informed by stable, farsighted information instead of deterministic decisions reliant on unstable and myopic information in previous methods.  On the CIFAR-10 dataset with the ResNet18 model, FedRTS achieves either a 5.1% accuracy improvement or a 33.3% reduction in communication costs compared to SOTA frameworks.'
