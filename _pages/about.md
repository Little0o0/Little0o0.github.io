I am currently a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) in City University of Hong Kong (CityU). I obtained M.S. degree from the University of Florida (UF), advised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) and Prof. [Ruogu Fang](https://lab-smile.github.io/). I obtained B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 


Research Interest
=====
My research focuses on model acceleration/compression, with the overarching goal of __AI democratization__,making powerful AI accessible to everyone.

- Model Acceleration & Compression
  - Distributed Training & Inference: [\[NeurIPS 2025\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19122), [\[CVPR 2024\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14737), [\[ICDCS 2023\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01977) 
  - On-Device Learning & Inference: [\[ACL 2025\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14742), [\[Preprint\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23809) 
 
> I lead the [FedPruning Research Group](https://fedpruning.github.io/), which focuses on cutting-edge research in __edge computing__ and __model compression__. The group is dedicated to guiding __beginners__ in launching their research careers and currently comprises 15+ junior Ph.D. and M.S. students. We are looking for self-motivated students to join us (minimal requirements: familar with Deep learning and PyTorch.)
