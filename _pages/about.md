I am currently a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) in City University of Hong Kong. I obtained my Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Florida, advised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) and Prof. [Ruogu Fang](https://lab-smile.github.io/). I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

> I lead the [FedPruning Research Group](https://github.com/FedPruning), which focuses on cutting-edge research in __edge computing__ and __model compression__. The group is dedicated to guiding __beginners__ in launching their research careers and currently comprises 15+ junior Ph.D. and MS. students. We are looking for __self-motivated students__ to join us (minimal requirements: familar with Deep learning and PyTorch.)
