I am currently a Ph.D. candidate supervised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) in City University of Hong Kong (CityU). I obtained M.S. degree from the University of Florida (UF), advised by Prof. [Dapeng Oliver Wu](http://www.wu.ece.ufl.edu/) and Prof. [Ruogu Fang](https://lab-smile.github.io/). I obtained B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

Research Interest
=====
My research focuses on __Efficient AI__, with the overarching goal of __AI democratization__, _making powerful AI accessible to everyone._

- __Efficient AI__:
  - **Efficient LLM (_Bar Menu_)**:[\[Quaff ACL'25\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14742), [\[Tequila ICLR'26\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23809), [\[Sherry Preprint\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07892) 
  - **Efficient Federated Learning (_Fed- Series_)**:  [\[FedRTS NeurIPS'25\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19122), <br/>
  [\[FedMef CVPR'24\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14737),[\[FedTiny ICDCS'23\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01977) 
  - **Efficient ML System (_.cpp Series_)**: [\[Prima.cpp ICLR'26\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08791)
 
> I lead the [FedPruning Research Group](https://fedpruning.github.io/), which focuses on cutting-edge research in __edge computing__ and __model compression__. The group is dedicated to guiding __beginners__ in launching their research careers and currently comprises 15+ junior Ph.D. and M.S. students. We are looking for self-motivated students to join us (minimal requirements: familar with Deep learning and PyTorch.)
