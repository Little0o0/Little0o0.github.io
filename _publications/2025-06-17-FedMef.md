title: "[CVPR 2024] FedMef: Towards Memory-efficient Federated Dynamic Pruning"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'This paper proposes FedMef, a novel and memoryefficient federated dynamic pruning framework. FedMef comprises two key components: 1. Budget-aware Extrusion that maintains pruning efficiency 2. Scaled Activation Pruning effectively reduce activation memory footprints. FedMef significantly reduces the memory footprint of MobileNetV2 by 28.5% while improving the accuracy by more than 2%.'
